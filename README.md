### Overview

This project consists of five challenges using ternary operators to help Monster consumers to decide what kind they like and when it is best for them to have it. These operators provide an easily readable version of conditional statements.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

If/else statements: Since ternary operations are a simplified version of if/else statements, this exercise allowed me to practise if/else statements more in order to be able to efficiently create ternary operators.

Ternary operator syntax: I was able to get a firm grasp on how ternary operators are written, in terms of using the question mark(?) to instruct the runner to check the code and the : to declare the options.

Ternary operators in different instances: I was able to use the operators with numbers and strings.

#### Challenges Faced

In this project, I did not experience any significant challenges but one that stood out was mentioned in my areas of mastery and that was syntax. I would often forget to add brackets to avoid clashes with the curly braces to the function when using the if/else to practise. For example if (userPreference === Sugar-free). The console would often give me an error because of the mistake.

#### Areas for Improvement

More efficient use: For this project, I often needed the if/else statements in order to determine what information the ternary operators would require. Therefore further practice will allow me the ability to use the ternary operators without if/else statements.

Exploring: I would like to look further into what ternary operators can do in code.

#### Overall Learning Experience

All in all, this project was a valuable practice opportunity. It took me back to conditional statements and helped me understand them better. It also gave me new insight into ternary operators which are a more efficient, simpler and easier to read version of conditional statements.
